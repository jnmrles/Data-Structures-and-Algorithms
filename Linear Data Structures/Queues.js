// A Queue is a linear collection of nodes that exclusively adds nodes to the tail (enqueues), and removes (dequeues) nodes from the head of the queue
// EX. a grocery store line, people leave at the front of the line and people join the line at the back of the line

// Queues provide three methods for interaction:

// Enqueue - adds data to the “back” or end of the queue
// Dequeue - provides and removes data from the “front” or beginning of the queue
// Peek - reveals data from the “front” of the queue without removing it
